# c-projects
my c++ work (2024-present)

(Dec 29, 2024)
I am currently a first year student currently takin up computer engineering and c++ is the language that we use in class.
I have decided to start making c++ projects to learn more and practice what i have learned and compile them i order for me to access it, in the case my laptop no longer function and i lost all of my files. 
Maybe someday i will also be able to share this to others.
